        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/download.png') }}" alt="Our Mission" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Agronomics is a pioneering project designed to address the pressing challenges that farmers face in modern agriculture. One of the most significant issues is the delayed system in receiving real-time data, which hinders farmers' ability to make informed decisions promptly. This delay can result in poor crop management, wastage of resources, and ultimately, lower yield and income for farmers.</p>
        
        <h2>The Problem: Impact of Delayed Systems</h2>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/aff.jpg') }}" alt="Impact of Delayed Systems" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Farmers today rely on outdated and delayed systems for weather forecasting, pest management, and crop health monitoring. The lack of timely information often leads to decisions made too late, such as using the wrong fertilizers or pesticides at the wrong time. This causes financial losses and affects their crops, leading to poor harvests. Furthermore, this delay in accessing critical information hinders the adoption of new farming practices that could improve productivity and sustainability.</p>

        <h2>How Agronomics Helps</h2>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/happy.jpg') }}" alt="How Agronomics Helps" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Agronomics aims to solve these problems by providing farmers with a <strong>real-time system</strong> that offers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accurate Crop Detection:</strong> Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Agronomics can instantly detect crop types and provide detailed analysis of their health.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Weather Updates:</strong> Farmers receive timely weather forecasts to prepare for upcoming conditions, reducing crop damage due to adverse weather.</li>
            <li><strong>Pesticide and Fertilizer Recommendations:</strong> Based on crop health and soil conditions, Agronomics recommends the appropriate pesticides and fertilizers to use, saving resources and improving yields.</li>
            <li><strong>Government Scheme Alerts:</strong> The system also informs farmers about relevant government schemes and subsidies, helping them access financial assistance for better crop management.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With these features, Agronomics helps farmers make informed decisions in real-time, minimizing delays and improving overall agricultural efficiency. By reducing the time between problem detection and action, this project boosts crop productivity, enhances resource usage, and ultimately leads to better financial outcomes for farmers.</p>
